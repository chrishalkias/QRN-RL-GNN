TODO LIST:

    - Add star graph (one central node and all nodes around it)
        nodes can only EG with the central node. Now it is the other way around
        i.e 1 swap per node but can only EG with the middle node
        still 2 operations per node
    - Grid search? [https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-is-the-best-way-to-perform-hyper-parameter-search-in-pytorch/19943/3]
