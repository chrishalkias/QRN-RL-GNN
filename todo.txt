TODO LIST:

    - Remove mask, let agent learn to never swap a node without two connections
    - Grid search? [https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-is-the-best-way-to-perform-hyper-parameter-search-in-pytorch/19943/3]
    - New recipe
        1. Check the number of active links to the right of every node (except for the right-most node). 
        If there are inactive links, request the corresponding elementary link.

        2. Check the number of active links to the left and right of every node, except for the end nodes. 
        If more than one link on either side is active, rank them based on the policy, as described in detail
         in Quasi-local multiplexing policies. Perform the entanglement swapping operations in the ranked order. 
        Entanglement swapping is attempted only if the sum of the ages of the two links is less than m★.

        3. If entanglement distillation is part of the policy, attempt to distill all links between the same two
        nodes until either one or no link survives (also see Supplementary Note 2). 
        If the policy calls for distilling first, then swapping, interchange steps 2 and 3.

        4. Increase the age of all active links by one time unit, accounting for decoherence. 
        If classical communication (CC) overheads are to be accounted for, then add the CC time 
        to the age of every active link. Discard any link which has age greater than m★.
