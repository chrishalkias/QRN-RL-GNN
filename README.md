## About the project :zap:
This is the repository for my MSc thesis on studying entanglement distribution in ***quantum repeater networks*** using Reinforcement Learning. The goal of this project is to examine how Reinforcement Learning agents can learn eficcient policies for enanglement distribution.
The physical system used is Quantum repeaters. Big picture and outlook YouTube video from [QuTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iCFH9Fk184) and [Qunnect (animation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oqkFO4f-A).

The project has a similar scope to [Haldar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00777) but the idea is to use more complex geometries (repeater networks insdead of repeater chains) and more state of the art architectures for the RL agent ([Graph convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907), [Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), [Graph Attention networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)).
