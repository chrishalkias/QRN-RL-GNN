# Qonnect

This is *Qonnect* a simple tabular game that is played according to the rules of quantum repeater networks.

## Game description

Every edge $(i,j)$ is represented as a square in a grid of size $N^2$ and every entanglement is represented with a dot on the associated square.

The goal of the game is to have a dot on the square corresponding to the target end-to-end link $(i_A, i_B)$.

The two kinds of operations that can be performed (Entanglement and Swaping) are associated with the creation and merging of dots in the game.

Importantly since the system is represented by an undirected graph the game has a discrete reflection symmetry on the diagonal which turns out to be crucial for playing the game.
